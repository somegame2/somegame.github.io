On the other hand, I also face the problem in language because this is my first semester in Master. So I have to spend much time in reading the what you have write on the page but ignoring your operation so that I always cannot follow you, that mean I have to spend much time after class to catch what you have teach today.<br>\r\nWhile I think it is also a chance for me because after the whole semester I have a big improve in both language skill and Coding. I have got used to the Cloud 9 which I have never heard before and I learned a lot bash commands which also give me different experience.<br>\r\nAll the project you give me is a good challenge. Every project will cost me 20-30 hours, including group study and individual study. While I think it is very useful. After finish every project I Will proud of myself.<br>\r\nThe last project is my favorite one, which I am working, you show me another way to build a page, I think it is very useful in the future, maybe I can keep this page forever, also the gee-mail project show us how to encrypt and decode and also how to build a connect between sql and C++. in a word, I have a great improvement after this class.<br>\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n### Link of our projects\r\n 1.[Markov Sentence Generator](http://Markov.superl.online/)<br>\r\n 2.[Polynomial](http://polynomial.superl.online/)<br>\r\n 3.[Minesweeper](http://minesweeper.superl.online/)<br>\r\n 4.[Gee-mail -- in C++](http://gee%5Fmail.superl.online/)<br>\r\n   [Gee-mail -- in JAVA](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1i5nxPbR)<br>\r\n\r\n   If you have any question please contact me with email \"superl@udel.edu\"",
