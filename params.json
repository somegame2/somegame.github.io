On the other had, I also face the problem in language because this is my first semester In Master.\r\n\r\nSo I have to spend much time in reading what you have write on the page while sometime may ignore your operation so that I cannot follow you and I should spend much time after the class.\r\n\r\nWhile i think it is also a chance for me because after the whole semester I have a big improvement in both language and code, I have got used to the Cloud 9 which I have never heard before and I learned a lot bash commands which also give me different experience.\r\n\r\nAll the project you gave me is a challenge. Every project will cost me more than 20 hours to handle, including group study and individual study. While I think it is very useful. When i finish each project, I feel a strong a sense of achievement.\r\n\r\nNow I would like to make a simple conclusion about what I had learn from these project.\r\n\r\nThe first one is Markovia. At beginning we have no idea about Markovia, we have search a lot on the website, learn how to use map function and we finally just finish a level 1. To be honest that`s not a good beginning.\r\n\r\nThe second Project is about Polynomial, we need to read two words out from our text, that`s not easy because if the number in the text is minus our algorithm will not work, but we still proud of ourselves because we did it.\r\n\r\nThe third project is about minesweeper, In these project I think the key word is random and detection. detection how many mine around the coordinate, this is a real funny game and we made it .\r\n\r\nthe forth one is about gee-mail, this project is very hard for us because it sounds very professional, form this project we have learnt how to encryption how to decode and also use SQL to remember the custom or read and write e-mail.\r\n\r\nthe last project is about how to create a page easily, and also this is my favorite one and I think maybe I can keep this page in finding job.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What job i can take\r\nWell, as an employee, I think there are some position I can take after this class.\r\n\r\nThe first one I think is google mail or some company like that, because we really work hard in the project gee-mail and gain a lot. I think I have the ability to learn and create more security e-mail which we can use in our daily.\r\n\r\nThe second one I think I can go to some company which searching in reading application. The first project 'Markovian' give me lots of thought and I think this project is the key for the reading application.\r\n\r\nThe last one I want to take is a game company, because I found that all the things I take from this class is availiable for a game company, like the user log in (refer to gee-mail) orI can make a hero (dota) with some special skill in using random(the minesweeper give me such idea). I think it is very cool.\r\n\r\n### Link of our projects.\r\n[Polynomial](http://polynomial.superl.online/) \r\n[Markov](http://markov.superl.online/) \r\n[Minesweeper](http://minesweeper.superl.online/)\r\n[Gee mail](http://geemail.superl.online/)\r\n",
