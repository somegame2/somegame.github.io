### Welcome to Haopeng Ling Pages.
In this page i will show you something fun about the course 'Secure Software Design'.

### What have I learn from this course?
I think this course is a very big challenge for me because at beginning I am not good at C++. On the other hand, I also face the problem in language because this is my first semester in Master. So I have to spend much time in reading the what you have write on the page but ignoring your operation so that I always cannot follow you, that mean I have to spend much time after class to catch what you have teach today.<br>
While I think it is also a chance for me because after the whole semester I have a big improve in both language skill and Coding. I have got used to the Cloud 9 which I have never heard before and I learned a lot bash commands which also give me different experience.<br>
All the project you give me is a good challenge. Every project will cost me 20-30 hours, including group study and individual study. While I think it is very useful. After finish every project I Will proud of myself.<br>
Now lets just have a quick review about all the project and my gain.<br>
The first project is about the Markovian-tweets. At beginning we do not know what this project about because we do not know what is Markovian-tweets. We search a lot in the internet about how to match the message in our text and learn some function like 'map[]'. That is the key to figure this project out and then we finally we just finish level 1.<br>
The second project is about Polynomial. At beginning we thought that this is not very difficult because this project is very easy to understand. while things be different because we should put this two number into a text. However actually we made it, even if we have some weakness in calculate the minus. However I think we made a big progress.<br>
The third one we finished a simple game about Minesweeper. we learn a lot from this program such as random generation, how to set the mine and how to judge the surrounding coordinate is safe or not is what we learn.<br>
The forth project is about gee-mail. At beginning, i think it is impossible because it sounds so advanced, like how to log in, how to remember the user, how to encryption, how to decode, how to create the connection between database,these are all difficult for us. However, I much from this project because we solve most of these question.<br>
The last project is my favorite one, which I am working, you show me another way to build a page, it is very convenience and also very useful in the future, maybe I can keep this page forever.<br>

### What position I can take.
Well, as an employee, I think there are some position I can take after this class:<br>
The first one I think is google mail or some company like that, because we really work hard in the project gee-mail and gain a lot. I think I have the ability to learn and create more secure e-mail which we can use in our daily.<br>
The second one I think I can go to some company which searching in reading application. The first project 'Markovian-tweets' give me lots of thought and I think this project is the key for the reading application.<br>
The last one I want to take is game company. Because i found that all the things I take from this class is available, like the user log in(refer to gee-mail project) or I can make a hero(like dota) with some special skill in using random(the minesweeper give me such thought). I think it is very cool. <br>
