<p>In this page i will show you something fun about the course 'Secure Software Design'.</p>

<a id="what-have-i-learn-from-this-course" class="anchor" href="#what-have-i-learn-from-this-course" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What have I learn from this course?</h3>

<p>I think this course is a very big challenge for me because at beginning I am not good at C++. On the other hand, I also face the problem in language because this is my first semester in Master. So I have to spend much time in reading the what you have write on the page but ignoring your operation so that I always cannot follow you, that mean I have to spend much time after class to catch what you have teach today.<br>
While I think it is also a chance for me because after the whole semester I have a big improve in both language skill and Coding. I have got used to the Cloud 9 which I have never heard before and I learned a lot bash commands which also give me different experience.<br>
All the project you give me is a good challenge. Every project will cost me 20-30 hours, including group study and individual study. While I think it is very useful. After finish every project I Will proud of myself.<br>
The last project is my favorite one, which I am working, you show me another way to build a page, I think it is very useful in the future, maybe I can keep this page forever, also the gee-mail project show us how to encrypt and decode and also how to build a connect between sql and C++. in a word, I have a great improvement after this class.<br></p>
